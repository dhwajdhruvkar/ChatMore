# ChatMore

The Client-Server Chat Application is a communication solution built using Java Swing for the desktop client and Android for the mobile client. The application utilizes the socket package to establish communication between the clients and the server. It offers a simple and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to users with basic Java knowledge. The project is based on existing code found on the Internet, which has been modified to enhance simplicity and elegance.

Main Working:
The Client-Server Chat Application enables users to exchange messages in real-time by connecting to a central server. The application consists of two components: the client-side and the server-side.

The client-side of the application can be accessed through two platforms: a Java Swing-based desktop client and an Android mobile client. Users can log in to the client using their credentials and establish a connection with the server. Once connected, they can send and receive messages to and from other users connected to the same server.

The server-side component acts as the central hub for communication between the clients. It facilitates the establishment of connections, handles message routing, and maintains the overall chat environment. The server ensures that messages are relayed between clients efficiently and securely.

Technologies Used:

Java Swing: The desktop client of the chat application is built using Java Swing, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for Java. Swing provides the necessary components and layouts to create an intuitive and interactive user interface.

Android: The mobile client of the chat application is developed using the Android platform, which offers a robust framework for creating mobile applications. Android provides the necessary tools and libraries to build a user-friendly interface for seamless communication.

Socket Package: The socket package in Java is used to establish network communication between the client and the server. It enables the clients to establish a connection with the server and exchange messages over the network.
